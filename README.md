Apparel Textile Prediction (CNN + FastAPI + Streamlit)
* Built a CNN-based image classification model using the Fashion-MNIST dataset
* Classified apparel items such as T-shirt, Trouser, Dress, Coat, Bag, etc.
* Applied data preprocessing: resizing, grayscale conversion, normalization
* Trained and evaluated the model using TensorFlow / Keras
* Saved trained model in .h5 format for deployment
* Developed backend REST API using FastAPI
* Integrated model inference through /predict endpoint
* Built a simple Streamlit frontend for image upload and prediction
* Observed performance drop on real-world colored images due to dataset distribution mismatch
* Project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: training → API → UI
* Future improvement: use transfer learning and real-world image fine-tuning
